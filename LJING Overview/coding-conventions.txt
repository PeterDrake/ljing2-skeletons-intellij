All of the Learn Java in N Games code attempts to follow standard Java coding
conventions and practices. Good sources include:

Bloch, Effective Java
Christensen, Flexible, Reliable Software: Using Patterns and Agile Development
Vermeulen et al., The Elements of Java Style.

Some liberties are taken, especially in early programs, to improve clarity and
simplicity at the expense of robustness and generality.

The following conventions are specific to LJING:

The current player is stored in a variable or instance variable called
currentPlayer.

All drawing is done by a single method draw (or by methods called only from
draw). Draw begins with StdDraw.clear() and ends with StdDraw.show(). The run
method starts with StdDraw.enableDoubleBuffering().
